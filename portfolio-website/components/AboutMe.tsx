                Embarking on my journey to become a software engineer, I unearthed my passion 
                during the tumultuous days of O/Ls. Fueled by this discovery, I crafted simple 
                calculators using Visual Basic, igniting a spark that led to a series of 
                projects showcasing my evolving talents.

                Currently, I am working as an intern software engineer at WealthOS. Here, I 
                collaborate with a talented team to design and build scalable full-stack 
                applications, adhering to the best practices in software development and 
                testing, design patterns, coding standards, security standards, etc., in the industry.

                In the days of yore, I reveled in the immersive worlds of video games like 
                Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Red Dead Redemption 2. These virtual odysseys sparked a 
                new dream: to create my own captivating gaming universe. Thus, my free moments 
                are dedicated to mastering the arcane arts of Unreal Engine and Blender, whispering 
                promises of a future where I transition into the enchanting realm of the game industry.
